## Easy to use
Cubic employs an easy to learn component system, allowing you to easily create complex objects in your game worlds.

With a simple but powerful API, Cubic can be used by anyone, no matter their skill level!

## Cross platform
Cubic runs on all desktop platforms, Windows, Linux, and MacOS, with ease. No need to port any code, just copy your project over, and launch.

Cubic will soon run on the Raspberry Pi, as well as Android & iOS devices. (These are still WIP.)

## Extendable
Want to perform some custom rendering? Or forgo the built in component system? No problem! All the necessary tools are provided to allow you to directly access the backend renderer, allowing you to create anything you want!

You can write custom GLSL shaders that you can use in any way you like, so you can create amazing effects with a few lines of code!

## More than just a game engine...
Cubic is more than just a game engine, it's powerful enough to power not only games, but applications and tools too.

The possibilities are endless!
